## Deployment / Installation

There are multiple methods of running and deploying Composable UI.

Be sure to read the documentation on Composable UI's [environment variables](https://docs.composable.com/docs/essentials/configuration). When deploying to a cloud provider like Vercel or Netlify you must set the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable. For more information on Composable UI environment variables, see the [Application Configuration](../essentials/configuration.md) section. See these links on how to set environment variables for [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

  - [Option 2: 1-Click Deployment to Vercel](#option-2-1-click-deployment-to-vercel)
  - [Option 3: 1-Click Deployment to Netlify](#option-3-1-click-deployment-to-netlify)
  - [Option 4: Run in Docker](#option-4-run-in-docker)

You can host Composable UI on any service that supports Next.js.

After installing Composable UI, we recommend also taking a few moments to configure Algolia and Stripe to take full advantage of Composable UI's base features.

###  Option 1: Run in Localhost

To run locally, ensure that you have installed:

- Node.js v16.18.0 or higher
- pnpm v8.0 or higher

For more information about the installation, see the [Installation page](https://docs.composable.com/docs/getting_started/installation) section.

Perform the following operations in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/composable-com/composable-ui
cd composable-ui
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

You should now have the Composable UI application running locally. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

### Option 2: 1-Click Deployment to Vercel

Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of Composable UI to Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcomposable-com%2Fcomposable-ui&root-directory=composable-ui&project-name=composable-ui&repository-name=composable-ui&demo-title=Composable%20UI&demo-description=Open%20Source%20React%20Storefront%20for%20Composable%20Commerce&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorefront.composable.com%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fstorefront.composable.com%2Fimg%2Fdemo_image.png&envDescription=Enter%20your%20NEXTAUTH_SECRET.&env=NEXTAUTH_SECRET&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fnext-auth.js.org%2Fconfiguration%2Foptions%23nextauth_secret)

- You‚Äôll be prompted to authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name.
- Vercel will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the Composable UI repository.
- You will be prompted to enter a value for the NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable. See the NextAuth docs for more information, including a script for how to generate a secure secret that will be used for cookie JWT encryption.
- Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Vercel.

### Option 3: 1-Click Deployment to Netlify

Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of Composable UI to Netlify:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/composable-com/composable-ui&base=composable-ui#PNPM_FLAGS=--shamefully-hoist"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

- You‚Äôll be prompted to authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name.
- Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the Composable UI repository.
- You will be prompted to enter a value for the NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable. See the NextAuth docs for more information, including a script for how to generate a secure secret that will be used for cookie JWT encryption.
- Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify.

### Option 4: Run in Docker

You can also run the Composable UI app easily using Docker and not worry about local dependencies. If you don't already have Docker installed, first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before proceeding below.

Clone, build and run the Docker image:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/composable-com/composable-ui
cd composable-ui
docker-compose up --build
```

You should now have the Composable UI application running through Docker. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000>

## Configuring Algolia and Stripe

In order to take full advantage of Composable UI, you must configure Algolia and Stripe. If you do not, the Product Listing Page (PLP) and Checkout pages will not function correctly.

### Algolia Setup

You can use Algolia's free tier to get started.

[Follow the instructions](https://docs.composable.com/docs/integrations/search/algolia) in the documentation to configure Algolia.

### Stripe Setup

You can create a free Stripe account to get started.

[Follow the instructions](https://docs.composable.com/docs/integrations/payments/stripe) in the documentation to configure Stripe.

<!--
## Storybook Installation

Storybook is provided with a set of pre-built components to jumpstart your composable commerce project.

You can view the Storybook by running the following in terminal:

```sh
cd composable-ui/storybook
pnpm build
pnpm storybook
```

You should now have the Storybook application running locally. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:6006>
-->

---

## Documentation Installation

Composable UI comes with documentation powered by Docusaurus. We encourage contributing documentation alongside code.

You can run Docusaurus by executing the following in the terminal:

```sh
cd docs
yarn install
yarn start
```

You should now have the Docusaurus application running locally. Go to your web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3001>

Alternatively, you can view the latest documentation directly at <https://docs.composable.com>
